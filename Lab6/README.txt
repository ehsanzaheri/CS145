Tree Member Manager - Final Project by Sunny Zaheri

This Java program lets you manage a list of club members using a Binary Search Tree (BST).
You can register new members, delete existing ones, search by ID, and view all members
in In-Order, Pre-Order, or Post-Order traversal formats.

Files included:
- TreeMemberManager.java -> main file with the menu and user interaction
- ClubMember.java -> defines the ClubMember object (ID, name, address, city)
- MemberTree.java -> handles all BST logic like insert, delete, search, and traversal

To run:
1. Run the program:
   java TreeMemberManager

This version is clean, easy to use, and shows understanding of recursion, trees, and Java basics.

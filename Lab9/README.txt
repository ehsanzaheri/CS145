                                                                               Lab 9 - Bubble Sort Program
                                                                                     Author: Sunny Zaheri

       This project demonstrates how to sort a list of integers entered by the user using the Bubble Sort algorithm.


Files
     1. BubbleSortRunner.java – This is the main class. It handles user input, displays the original array, calls the sorting method, and then prints the sorted array.
     2. BubbleSortHelper.java – This class contains the bubbleSort method that performs the actual sorting logic.
     3. README.txt – This file.


How to Run
     1. Compile the Java files using:
            javac BubbleSortRunner.java BubbleSortHelper.java

     2. Run the program using:
            java BubbleSortRunner

     3. Follow the prompts to enter the number of elements and the values to be sorted.


Description
     The Bubble Sort algorithm works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. 
     This version includes a small optimization that stops the algorithm early if no swaps are needed during a full pass.

     This lab reinforces concepts like:
          - Loops and conditionals
          - Arrays
          - Writing modular code (separating logic into helper classes)
          - Basic algorithm implementation in Java

Welcome to Lab 7: Lowest Common Divisor (LCD) using Recursion

LCD_Java.java:

This Java code is working fine. This gives the LCD of 2 numbers using recursion. It iterates over each divisor starting from 2 (all the way up) in order to find the largest common divisor.

LCD_Python.py:

This is another Python program which finds the LCD using recursion. It does raise an error if the recursion goes too deep (the LCD is greater than 3). This is because of Python’s default recursion limit.

Note:

Use the half ampersand with multiple lower || handles > |T| - anyone between |Q| and |T| is OK.

— The Python version can fail if the recursion depth exceeds the limit, but that’s easily adjusted by changing Python’s recursion depth limit.

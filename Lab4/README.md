# CS145-Lab4
Description:

In this lab, I implemented a Blackjack game using stacks. I wrote classes for the deck, the dealing and the game logic. This enables a player to play against computer opponents, where cards are drawn until a user decides to stop or exceeds 21 (bust).

How it works:

The game shuffles a deck of cards, and deals 2 cards to each player (the player and the computer).

The player can draw more cards while the computer will continue drawing cards until it scores 16 or higher.

The game continues as long as either player or the computer does not bust—that is, a score above 21, or until both players stop drawing cards. Then, the scores are compared to find out the victor.
